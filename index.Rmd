The systemic oppression of minorities, particularly African Americans, in the American prison system continues to be exposed through effective data analytics. This report seeks to analyze prison population rates, both across racial groups and states. In this report, I primarily work with variables related to prison population rates. The total prison population rate variable is based on the number of people held in state prison on December 31 of a given year in relation to the total population of the county of commitment. Similarly, this variable can be disaggreated to express the rate that specific racial groups are committed to state prisons.
In generating this report, several values of interest emerged. First, the state with the highest average rate of Black imprisonment is `r highest_state`. Furthermore, the county with the highest average rate of Black imprisonment is `r highest_county`, also located in Nebraska. The state with the lowest average rate of Black imprisonment was found to be `r lowest_state`. Across all states, the average rate of Black imprisonment was calculated to be approximately `r avg_rate`. Comparing this national average across a 10 year period, from 1996 to 2016, revealed an increase of `r change_rate`.

This chart was intended to show the influence of race on rate of imprisonment. The overwhelming discrepancy in the rate of imprisonment between Black individuals and individuals of every other observed race is one of, if not the most, meaningful patterns that emerged.

Building off of the previous chart, this chart was intended to highlight the significant difference in rate that the Black population is imprisoned in relation to all other racial groups. In a literal sense, this chart visualizes the overwhelming racial gap observed in state prisons. While fluctuating, the black prison population rate is always more than two times larger than the total prison population rate--and sometimes nearly three times larger!

This chart was intended to illustrate the influence of geographic location on average rates of black population imprisonment. In constructing this graphic, I chose to include states with no reported data. In doing so, I hope their lack of both available information and transparency does not go unnoticed. In terms of patterns, this chart reveals generally lower rates of imprisonment in coastal states compared to states in the southern and central U.S.
